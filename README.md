# Algorithms Practice

This repo contains code for the following algorithms: 

### Branch & Bound
üí° Used for combinatorial optimization problems.  
‚û°Ô∏è Bin Packing Problem, Job Scheduling Problem, Traveling Salesman Problem  
‚ÑπÔ∏è It divides the solution space into smaller subproblems and systematically explores it. Before going through all possible options of particular branch, the branch is estimated against the upper / lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution. If it's clear that it can't produce a better solution, the branch is discarded.   
üõÑ My implementation solves the problem of optimally packing suitcases so that the number of suitcases is minimized while staying within the airline's weight limit.
