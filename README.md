# Algorithms Practice

This repo contains code for the following algorithms: 

### Branch & Bound
üí° Used for combinatorial optimization problems. //
‚û°Ô∏è Bin Packing Problem, Job Scheduling Problem, Traveling Salesman Problem //
‚ÑπÔ∏è It divides the solution space into smaller subproblems and systematically explores it. Before going through all possible options of particular branch, 
the branch is estimated against the upper / lower estimated bounds on the optimal solution. If it's clear 
that it can't produce a better solution, the branch is discarded.
